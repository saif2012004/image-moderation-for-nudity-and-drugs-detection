# ML-Based Image Moderation System

## 1. Dataset Collection & Preparation

### Nudity Detection

```bash
# Download datasets
wget https://github.com/rockyzhengwu/nsfw-resnet/releases/download/v0.1/nsfw_resnet.h5
wget https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model/releases/download/1.1.0/nsfw_mobilenet_v2_140_224.tflite

# Or use existing models:
- Yahoo's Open NSFW Model
- NudeNet (pre-trained)
- NSFW Detector
```

### Drug Detection

```bash
# Custom dataset creation needed:
1. Collect 10,000+ images of:
   - Pills/medications
   - White powders
   - Drug paraphernalia
   - Cannabis plants/products
   - Syringes, pipes, etc.

2. Label categories:
   - pills, powder, paraphernalia, plants, safe
```

### Weapon Detection

```bash
# Use COCO dataset + custom collection:
1. Filter COCO for weapon classes
2. Add custom weapon images
3. Categories: guns, knives, explosives, safe
```

### Hate Symbol Detection

```bash
# Custom dataset required:
1. ADL Hate Symbols Database
2. Historical symbols
3. Text-based hate content
4. Geometric patterns
```

## 2. Model Architecture

### Option A: Transfer Learning (Recommended)

```python
# Use pre-trained models and fine-tune
- ResNet50/EfficientNet for base
- Custom classification heads for each category
- Multi-task learning approach
```

### Option B: Custom CNN

```python
# Build from scratch if needed
- Convolutional layers
- Attention mechanisms
- Multi-output classification
```

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection** (2-3 days)
2. **Data Preprocessing** (1 day)
3. **Model Training** (2-3 days)
4. **Integration** (1 day)
5. **Testing & Validation** (1 day)

## 4. Required Tools

- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib (visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- GPU for training (recommended)

## 5. Model Performance Targets

- Accuracy: >95% on validation set
- False Positive Rate: <2%
- Inference Time: <500ms per image
- Model Size: <100MB for deployment
